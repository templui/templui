## About this repository

This repository is a single Go module.

- We use [Go](https://go.dev) and [templ](https://templ.guide) for development.
- We use [Task](https://taskfile.dev) as our task runner.
- We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `cmd/docs`                      | The server for the docs website.         |

## Development

### Fork this repo

You can fork this repo by clicking the fork button in the top right corner of this page.

### Clone on your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/templui.git
```

### Navigate to project directory

```bash
cd templui
```

### Create a new Branch

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
go mod download
```

### Run the website

You can use the `task dev` command to start the development process.

```bash
task dev
```

This runs the `templ` watcher and the Tailwind CSS watcher in parallel and serves the website at `http://localhost:8090`.

## Running the CLI Locally

To run the CLI locally, you can follow the workflow:

1. Start by running the dev server:

   ```bash
   task dev
   ```

2. In another terminal tab, install the CLI from your working tree:

   ```bash
   go install ./cmd/templui
   ```

   To test the CLI against your local registry, use a command like:

   ```bash
   templui <init | add | ...> --registry http://localhost:8090
   ```

   You can also set the registry via the `TEMPLUI_REGISTRY` environment variable.

This workflow ensures that you are running the most recent version of the registry and testing the CLI properly in your local environment.

## Documentation

The documentation for this project lives on the website. You can run the documentation locally by running the following command:

```bash
task dev
```

Documentation is written using Markdown. You can find the documentation files in the `internal/service/content/docs` directory.

## Components

We use a registry system for developing components. You can find the source code for the components under `components`. Each component lives in its own directory with a `.templ` file and an optional `.js` file.

```bash
components
├── button
│   └── button.templ
└── dialog
    ├── dialog.js
    └── dialog.templ
```

When adding or modifying components, please ensure that:

1. You make the changes for every style (`assets/css/styles/style-*.css`).
2. You update the documentation.
3. You run `task dev`. The dev server regenerates the registry, so there is no separate build step.

## Requests for new components

If you have a request for a new component, please open a discussion on GitHub. We'll be happy to help you out.

## CLI

The `templui` package is a CLI for adding components to your project. You can find the documentation for the CLI [here](https://templui.io/docs/cli).

Any changes to the CLI should be made in the `cmd/templui` directory. If you can, it would be great if you could add tests for your changes.

## Testing

Tests are written using [Go's testing package](https://pkg.go.dev/testing). You can run all the tests from the root of the repository.

```bash
go test ./...
```

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features, please include tests.
